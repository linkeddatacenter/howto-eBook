	4.8 Summary of Linked Data visualization tool requirements</h2>
<p class="calibre1">As described in section 4.4 Linked Data visualizations need to offer <em class="calibre8">data navigation and exploration</em> capabilities. Particularly, given the scale of the data, it is unlikely that a static visualization will provide an adequate view on the data for all purposes. This will involve providing <em class="calibre8">user interaction</em> capabilities such as being able to query data of interest, filtering values and folding or expanding parts of the visualization. Visualizations should also exploit the <em class="calibre8">data structures</em> that are inherent in Linked Data such as such as ontology or taxonomy hierarchies. Ideally, it should be possible for the user to <em class="calibre8">publish</em> or share their visualizations using standard presentation formats for easy distribution. This ability to share should also apply to the extracted data, that is, the particular viewpoint on the data established in the selection and user manipulation of the visualization tool.</p>
