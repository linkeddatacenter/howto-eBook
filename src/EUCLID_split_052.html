	4.5 Challenges for Open Linked Data visualization</h2>
<p class="calibre1">When we consider <em class="calibre8">Linked Open Data</em> rather than just Linked Data, further challenges need to be addressed. First, the data of interest may be partitioned across <em class="calibre8">different repositories</em>. Assembling the data of interest will therefore require access to multiple datasets. Second, the assembled <em class="calibre8">heterogeneous data</em> may model the concepts in different ways. Alternative formats may also be used for values. For example in different repositories date information may be variously represented as DD-MM-YYYY, MM-DD-YYYY or just YYYY. Third, working with a dataset assembled from multiple repositories increases the likelihood of <em class="calibre8">missing data</em>. Visualizations will need to be able to handle the level of missing data and perhaps also indicate to the user data that cannot be represented in the selected visualization.</p>
