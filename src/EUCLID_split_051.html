	4.4 Challenges for Linked Data visualization</h2>
<p class="calibre1">The domain of Linked Data delivers a number of challenges for Linked Data. First, there is the challenge of scalability. The data of interest, for example returned from a SPARQL query of a dataset could be vast. Visualization techniques need to be used that can scale to large amounts of data. The visualizations tools also need to be powerful and efficient enough to render the information with an acceptable timescale.</p>
<p class="calibre1">One useful way of addressing scale is to provide visualizations that enable <em class="calibre8">user interac</em>tion. All data of potential interest then does not need to be provided within a single static view. The user has control over the visualization, allowing navigation through the data. User interaction functionality may also provide support for user editing of the data or annotation of the visualization itself. When visualizing the data, the user may spot errors or omissions that could be fixed interactively through the visualization. The user may also wish to highlight or make comments about some region of the data, essentially adding metadata to the dataset.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Linked data visualizations and the software mechanisms used to construct them should ideally be <em class="calibre8">reusable</em>. Developing tools to produce visualizations such as such as maps and timelines involves a lot of effort. It is therefore more efficient to produce generic tools that can be reused with many datasets. The emergence of standards for representing types of data (such as time and location information) facilitates the use of visualization tools. Ideally, the resulting visualizations should also be reusable and sharable using standard formats.</p>
