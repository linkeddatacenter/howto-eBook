	5.8 Logic and presentation layers</h2>
<p class="calibre1">Once the integrated data is available on-the-fly or in a triplestore, it can be used and accessed by the logic and presentation layers. As mentioned above, some of the logic may be implemented in the data layer by reasoning over the triplestore. Other forms of processing that cannot be implemented on the data later are carried out in the logic layer. As described in section 23 of Chapter 4, this may involve the application of statistical or machine learning processes to make inferences from the data. Other forms of business logic such as workflow are also implemented within this layer. Finally, the presentation layer displays the information to the user in various formats, including text, diagrams or other types of visualization techniques. A range of tools and formalisms for the display of information were outlined in Chapter 4.</p>
