	5.4 Architecture of Linked Data applications</h2>
<p class="calibre1">In the previous section we saw a number of example Linked Data applications. Each application not only had a different purpose but also made different architectural decisions in terms of how the data was accessed, processed and stored. In this section we present generic architectural patterns of Linked Data applications and different design decisions associated with these patterns.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The term<em class="calibre8"> software architecture</em> describes the components of a software system and the relationships between those elements.  For a web-based system the components could include software modules, databases and web servers. Some parts of the architecture may be legacy components brought forward from previous systems. The relationships between the components of a system indicate which components communicate during operation of the system and the mechanisms by which that communication takes place. As well as specifying the structure of the system, the software architecture also stipulates a set of design practices to be followed in order to create and maintain the architecture. </p>
