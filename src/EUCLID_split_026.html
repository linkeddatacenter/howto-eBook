<h2 id="calibre_toc_57" class="calibre7">3.1 Introduction</h2>
<p class="calibre1"><span>In the previous chapter we described how SPARQL is used to formulate queries and retrieve information from a dataset. In this chapter we look at how such datasets can be created and made available in the first place. We will describe how data can be extracted from different sources such as texts and databases and then represented as linked data using the RDF data model. We also show how relationships can be used to express connections between datasets as well define concepts used in a dataset in terms of a different vocabulary. We will also describe the steps involved in making the dataset accessible and discoverable.</span></p>
<p class="calibre1"><span>In this chapter we once again use MusicBrainz as a motivating example. MusicBrainz is used to show how different music data sources, stored in for example, databases and texts can be prepared, matched to the MusicBrainz schema and made available as a linked data source.</span></p>
<p class="calibre1"><span>The final sections provide a practical introduction to a number of tools that assist in the process of providing linked data.</span></p>
