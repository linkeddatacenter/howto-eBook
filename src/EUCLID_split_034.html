<p class="calibre1"><span>Data catalogs, markets or repositories are platforms that provide access to a wide range of contributed datasets. They assist data consumers in finding and accessing new datasets. Catalogs generally offer relevant metadata about the dataset. The open source platform CKAN can be used for managing and providing access to a large number of datasets. CKAN would be recommended for a large institution that wanted to manage access to a number of datasets. The Data Hub is a public linked data catalog to which datasets can be contributed. CKAN and Data Hub will be described in more detail in section 3.7.</span></p>
